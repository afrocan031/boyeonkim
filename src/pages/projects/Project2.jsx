            I was in charge of the project leader for the first time and create wireframes.

First, what I did was analyze Google analysis data to derive the problem of product registration. And My team discussed it several times to find a solution to this problem.

The key to the main solution is the OCR solution, so our team verified the recognition rate.

Furthermore, I fully grasped the development logic and articulate that through the proposal PPT design to stakeholders got imaginations.

           User Research - User behavior analysis
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Fortunately, I can get raw data through Google Analytics, including user clicks, views, drop counts, and more.
I gathered product registration data from all worldwide websites, analyzed user behavior in each part of the process, and compared data from individual country websites. 
During this period, I had several meetings with the Project Manager and stakeholders to align my team's opinions and ensure everyone was on the same page.

         Identified Pain Points from User Research : 
         <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
            <li className="mb-2">
              Approximately 50% of users abandoned the product registration process during the information input stage, indicating a need to simplify or support the input flow.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              The conversion rate to the product registration page differed by over 30% depending on whether a login was required, suggesting that mandatory login acts as a barrier to entry.

        It was the first time we were implementing OCR technology in the company. We needed to verify the accuracy and research pricing. My entire team helped with the testing.
-The accuracy was around 60% and heavily depended on the quality of the photo.
My team considered the result inevitable.

          />

The solution's pricing was based on specific cases, and the possibility of charging was minimal.

            Add the option to upload images using user-friendly terms. (Not using OCR)
            When you upload a photo of the attached labels from products, the system should automatically fill in the serial number field.

        <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Implemented an optional photo input feature in the product registration flow, allowing users to extract and auto-fill serial numbers, enhancing usability and reducing manual input.

        <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
           As the project leader, I took full responsibility for navigating the project from start to finish. During the proposal phase, I had the opportunity to analyze data, draw insights, and make presentations to both the Project Manager and LG.com Project Manager multiple times. This experience helped me develop to the next level. I also had to convince clients to adopt new methods, which taught me the importance of thinking outside the box.
