          HELP IT 1.0 provided two methods for responding: replies or comments. However, in 2.0, we streamlined this to one method to avoid user confusion about where to find answers. Additionally, we retained the comment function and created answer templates that the technician (administrator) can use to load predefined responses.
          
          Given this user behavior, I've decided to enhance the search function using personal data. This will include saving and showing users' search keywords, and recommending keywords for each menu.

           As the project leader, I felt a strong sense of responsibility and guided the project from start to finish. I learned the importance of effective client communication and regularly held meetings to build a friendly relationship. This helped me understand the client's genuine needs. 
           The company I worked with was responsible for creating the website and providing maintenance services. After the website was launched, I consistently maintained it. During the storyboard creation process, I carefully considered its scalability.
