          Platform switching for Library integration system

        <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
         Full redesign and platform migration of a legacy library system used by librarians, which had become difficult to maintain or update due to outdated architecture. Oversaw the transition to a modern, maintainable platform and restructured the reservation logic to reduce user wait times and improve operational efficiency.

              <li className="mb-2">
                Maintained existing database schema to avoid costly data migration; grouped same-title books through logical ID mapping.

                Balanced DevExpress performance overhead with system responsiveness for high-frequency librarian tasks.

        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-white">1. Reduced user reservation wait time by approx. 2-4 weeks</h3>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
              <li className="mb-2">
                Before:
                Each physical copy of the same title required a separate reservation. Users had to wait specifically for the exact reserved copy to be returned, often causing long delaysâ€”even when other copies were returned earlier.
              </li> 
              <li className="mb-2">
                After:
                Reservations were redesigned at the title level, allowing the first available copy to be loaned to the next person in the queue. This significantly reduced average wait times and improved overall reservation efficiency.

          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Implemented an automated lending/return logic by using a Y/N loan status flag, enabling instant processing upon barcode scan. Personally conducted multi-book lending/return tests using a barcode scanner to verify functionality and effectiveness.
